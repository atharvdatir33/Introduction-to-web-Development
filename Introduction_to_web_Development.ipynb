        "\n",
        " - Client-server architecture consists of **clients**, **servers**, and a **network**. The client sends requests (e.g., for web pages or data) and displays the received information to the user. The server processes these requests, manages data, and returns the requested content or services. The network facilitates communication between clients and servers using protocols like HTTP or TCP/IP. Optional **middleware** can help with tasks like data translation, load balancing, and security. Together, these components ensure efficient service delivery in modern applications.\n",

        " -A web browserâ€™s **developer tools** play a crucial role in web development by providing a suite of utilities to debug, inspect, and optimize websites. Key functions include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - DOM Inspection:** Allows developers to view and modify the structure and styles (HTML and CSS) of a webpage in real-time.\n",
        "   \n",
        "  - CSS Styling:** Enables real-time editing of CSS, testing layout changes, and adjusting styles without modifying the actual codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - JavaScript Debugging:** Provides tools for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and viewing variable values to identify and fix JavaScript errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Network Monitoring:** Tracks all network requests, including resources loaded and their response times, helping optimize performance and identify issues like slow-loading assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Performance Analysis:** Offers insights into page load speed, rendering times, and other performance metrics to enhance website efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Security Checks:** Identifies and flags potential security issues like mixed content or unsecured scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Responsive Design Testing:** Simulates different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure a site is mobile-friendly and works across various devices.\n",

        "4.What are the advantages of using a Version Control System like Git in a development project\n",
        " - Using Git in development offers key advantages like **collaboration**, allowing multiple developers to work without overwriting changes. It provides **version tracking**, **branching/merging** for feature development, and **backup/recovery** for easy rollback. Git also ensures **code integrity** by managing conflicts, supports **experimentation** in isolated branches, and integrates with tools like GitHub for enhanced collaboration. Additionally, it provides an **audit trail** for clear project history and accountability.\n",

        "- Text Editor vs. IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  \n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Text Editor:**  \n",
        "- **Purpose:** Simple tool for writing and editing plain text or code.  \n",
        "- **Key Features:** Syntax highlighting, basic auto-completion, and file management (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).  \n",
        "- **Use Cases:** Lightweight coding, quick edits, or small projects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**2. IDE:**  \n",
        "- **Purpose:** Comprehensive tool for software development with multiple integrated features.  \n",
        "- **Key Features:** Advanced code editing, debugging, version control, project management, and build automation (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).  \n",
        "- **Use Cases:** Complex projects requiring collaboration, debugging, or deployment.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Comparison:**  \n",
        "- **Simplicity:** Text editors are faster and easier to use, while IDEs are more complex but offer more functionality.  \n",
        "- **Flexibility:** IDEs are tailored to specific languages/environments, while text editors are more versatile with plugins.  \n",
        "- **Performance:** Text editors are lighter on resources; IDEs can be heavier but more powerful.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Both tools are essential depending on project size and development needs.\n",
